# GAMR
GAMR (Game Analytics â€“ Mixed Reality) is an analytic tool designed to bridge the gap in game analytics for mixed reality (MR) games, providing a comprehensive suite for analyzing and evaluating player behavior. To get started, check out the samples available in the **GAMR-AA** and **GAMR-FPS** branches. Please note, this tool is currently designed exclusively for HoloLens 2.

**The samples and tool were developed using Unity 2020.3.18.**

## Getting Started
The tool is already integrated with the samples. To use it, follow these steps:
- Install [Unity 2020.3.18](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)
- Clone the sample branch
- Install the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) if it is not already included in the project.
- Verify that the MRTK objects are present in the scene.
